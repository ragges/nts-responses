Hello Benjamin,

Thank you very much for your thorough review and all your comments!
This has helped us improve on the text in many places.

The service discovery is not in scope for this draft, and we anticipate
several different methods in the future. There are already discussions
going on on the ntp mailing list.
We therefore do not specify these things here, but want to refer to
the relevant specifications for the different methods.

Again, we anticipate several different methods.

The cookie is not encrypted from client to server (since the server
does not yet know what C2S key to use, it is in the cookie), but
encrypted when sent from the server to the client, for unlinkability.
The text was a bit confusing, we added a reference to clear this up.

Thanks - there used to be a Critical bit in the registry, but as you
saw is not any more. It now removed from the text too.

The reasoning behind this was that the protocol allows for this,

We neither, so we decided to let it be (there are a lot of last

We could not see a big advantage of changing it, it would have to be
changed in several places, so we let it be.

This has been debated back and forth several times, and the last time
it was still an argument that there were a lot of installations that
would have had troubles supporting TLS 1.3, so demanding 1.3 would
have slowed down the adoption rate.

We don't really see how that attack would work.

Yes, a machine could be both a NTS-KE client and server, for example an
NTS enabled stratum 2 server box. With bad configuration, it could
potentially use itself as a server, including negotiating cookies
and keys for itself, just as can be done with an NTP server today
(but if nothing else the NTP stratum mechanism should make that
time link useless).

We could not figure out a reasonable way to fix this to make it

Correct, the protocol that uses the key material will not use this
TLS connection.

The critical bit should only be checked if the receiver does not
recognise the record id, see Section 4, page 9 of the draft.

Yes, that is pretty much the expectation, though details from the

You are right. We have updated this to get it more explicit.

We intend this to be a version number, should it ever be needed.

Indeed, this should be handled by the TLS layer.

Yes. It is all described in the following section (5.3).

Good point, we have now changed it to "SHOULD be all zeros".
(It also avoids sending data from uninitialised buffers.)

It will be limited by the maximum UDP packet size. We can't see any
reason to put any upper boundaries on the padding, since having more
than necessary will mainly harm the sender, and the harm to the
receiver (e.g. filling packet reassembly buffers) could likely be
accomplished anyway with or without padding.

The number of cookie placeholders can be seen from the packet size
anyway, so there is no real gain in hiding them.

Here, exponential is just an example, it may be dependant on the
application, e.g. something with very low available bandwidth
and/or low time dependancy may not want to waste cycles on this,
and the exact rate limiting methods and constants may need to change 
hen we get more knowledge or other external circumstances change.

Do we really have to explicitly specify that for a secret key?

We have changed this to a "N" since that was our understanding was
correct for this kind label, but almost immediately Rich asked why.
If Rich and/or other knowledgeable persons are of another opinion,
we will not oppose to change back.

If a client gets its keys compromised, of any kind, there is a pretty

This would prevent mobile clients from using stored cookies. In the

The NTP Server Negotiation record is used by NTS-KE and is not an
NTP extension field. There is no need to protect against packet
expansion when using the TCP/TLS based NTS-KE part of NTS.

Half of the round-trip time after the delay attack. The round-trip
time is typically limited to 1 second in many implementations.
We have added a link to the referenced paper where this is explained.

This is about not accepting a downgrade from NTS-protected to
unprotected (traditional) NTP. Wether cookies are reused or not is
another issue, and is only about unlinkability of the client vs
resilience of the time link.

Likely that was what was meant, but not necessarily, there are
other ways, to identify a server, the time scale, for example.

The text has been updated to better reflect this.
