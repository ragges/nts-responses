We would again like to thank all of you who have sent comments and discuss issues for the overwhelming response from the reviewers and others. It has taken a lot of work to go through it all, but we do think that the quality of the specification has improved significantly.

During this work, it became apparent that keeping support for TLS 1.2 and  correctly covering for all the differences between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 would be a lot of work, with the risk of getting something wrong or missing on important issues, in the specification or in the implementations.
The last time the issue of 1.2 support was up for debate, there were some operation systems that would not support TLS 1.3, and there was a concern that this would impair the protocol adoption rate. Today most (all?) major operating systems do have TLS 1.3 enabled libraries in their later versions.
For older operating systems, the NTS enabled NTP implementation can still be linked with a modern TLS library, a bit inconvenient, but doable.

While we were at it, we also changed the TLS export disambiguating label string to be more aligned with what others use, to "EXPORTER-network-time-security".
