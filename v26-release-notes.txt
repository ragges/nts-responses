All,

We would again like to thank all of you who have sent comments and
discuss issues for the overwhelming response from the reviewers and
others.

We also got some comments on the comments. With this version, we
hopefully have addressed those too.

- No TLS 1.2
During this work, it became apparent that keeping support for TLS 1.2
and correctly covering for the differences between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3
would be a lot of work, with the risk of getting something wrong or
missing on important issues, in the specification or in the
implementations.

The last time the issue of 1.2 support was up for debate, there were
some operating systems that would not support TLS 1.3, and there was a
concern that this would impair the protocol adoption rate. Today most
(all?) major operating systems do have TLS 1.3 capable libraries in
their later versions.

Several of the reviewers questioned why TLS 1.2 was supported, and the
same have others done before.

We therefore decided to drop support for TLS 1.2.

For older operating systems, an NTS enabled NTP implementation can
still be linked with a separate TLS library that supports 1.3, a bit
inconvenient, but doable.

- New TLS export disambiguating label string
As we had a techincal change in there already, we also changed the TLS
export disambiguating label string to be more aligned with what is the
standard form today, to "EXPORTER-network-time-security".

Best regards,
Ragnar Sundblad
