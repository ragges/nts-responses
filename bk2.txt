### XXX ###
Issue #172

We have added a text that implementations must obey the rules in
RFC 5280 and RFC 6125 and that we recommend the use of DNS-ID,
and hope this will suffice.

We would like to again emphasise that service discovery and the
related server verification is a subject currently being worked
on in the WG.

We finally got your point, and have changed them to "can" now. Thanks!

This and other issues showed that keeping 1.2 support would have
required handling several special cases and considerations for the
use of 1.2 vs >=1.3. It would also risk getting any of them wrong,
or missing some, in the specification or the implementations.

We have now removed support for 1.2 and require >=1.3.
A big step, but it is now or never.

For running on older OS:es without native 1.3 support, the
implementations will have to be linked to a separate library
supporting 1.3. This is inconvenient, but doable.

Since the protocol currently only supports a single request which gets a
single reply, this should not be a problem until someone makes changes
to do more interactions per session. We opted to not change this now,
since this would be a larger change that should be thought through,
and that can be handled by that future change.

Right, and this also seems to be the contemporary way of doing it.
We opted to do this change now. Thanks for the suggestion!

Since we can't describe and explicitly forbid every possible way
someone could make bad decisions in their designs, and since this is
not part of the NTS protocol, we opted to not changes this.

We added an extra "secret" before "key K" in the text though, to
emphasise that it is.

Right, we added a new section ("Key Compromise") to describe the

(The missing reply was an oversight, by me.)

We believe that this will be handled by the ongoing work on NTS
service discovery etc. in the WG. In addition, it is a question
about implementation and application.

The client MUST only accept responses that are authentic under
the S2C key associated with the corresponding request.

So stripping of NTS extensions from the NTP response (or sending
a fake response) should (=MUST) just lead to the client
discarding the response without further processing.

We added a more explicit text in "Protocol Details" to emphasise
this: "The client MUST NOT accept unprotected responses to
NTS-protected requests.".

We also changed a word in "NTS Stripping" to make it more clear
that this should not be possible to do.

If the attacker can block the KE server traffic, it could likely
block any traffic, and then the client could find itself without
time service or any other service, with or without NTS.
(We would love to be able to solve this, it would fix so many
things, from attacks to broken cables, we regret to say that
NTS is not the answer to this.)
